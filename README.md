# GOG-only-games

Because this gets requested so often, here is a repost of a current list of games that are only available on GOG.

Although you still might get old CDs or DVDs of a lot of games, GOG maintains compatibility of these games with current OSes. This list just got cross-checked against the [List of GOG games that aren't available in Steam](https://www.gog.com/forum/general/list_of_gog_games_that_arent_available_in_steam/page6) list on GOG. Here is a list of games that you only get on GOG or where only the GOG version is playable, or where other platforms are missing add-ons and DLCs, or other features:

## GOG Exclusive Games

My list of GOG exclusive games (games that are neither on Steam nor on Origin) is originally based on the link above. (`✔` = Cross-checked against Steam, Origin, Zoom, etc... by me and others.) A list including all stuff, old and “new”. Feel free to let me know about any errors, etc.

## Free Games on GOG

Games that are free on GOG are marked with the symbol `­∅`.

**New**: *If free games are also available somewhere else, a `→` is put right next to the `⊘`, and optionally the other platform(s) are named as well.*

## Playability of games

I added some entries where the GOG version is actually playable in contrast to e.g. the Steam version, as noted by other redditors and/or by Steam users. If the status of a game is not sure, it’ll be marked with a `?`. Games are listed in alphanumerical order, ignoring articles and pronouns at the beginning, like “I” or “The”.

## You want to contribute?

If you find any changes and want to contribute to this list then it’s more helpful to add the changes and modifications to this document directly and choose the option “Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Learn more about pull requests.” instead of posting an issue. This way I get automatic messages about the changes and I can simply review the pull request if the change is correct. It makes life a little easier for me.
Thank you for your contribution! I appreciate your help very much!

It only takes a few simple steps:

* Click on the pen symbol in the upper right corner of the file view.
* Make your changes directly in the document
* Write a short description of your change in the line below “Commit changes” (the line that says “Update README.md”). The text box below that is for longer descriptions, if needed.
* Below the text boxes, click the radio button for “Creat a **new branch** for this commit and start a pull request.”
* Click on “Propose changes”
* That’s it, you’re done!

## Cleanup

I’ll strike through games that got recently taken off the list, so everyone can see more recent changes more easily. Delisted games, in particular, will be denoted with `✘`. Recent additions will be marked with a `♥` and in boldface.
I’ll clean up the list every few weeks.
